# HX3.5 Firmware

### Future repository for HX3.5 Firmware C++ conversion

HX3.5 firmware was compiled with older AVRCo Pascal IDE from [**e-lab**](https://www.e-lab.de/) which is free of charge now. It runs on a ATmega644A-PU MCU (see AVRco directory).

We plan to port it to PlatformIO IDE with Arduino framework for easier compilation and portability.
